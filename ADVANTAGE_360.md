# my keyboard remaps

I remapped:
- ESC -> `
- HOME -> UP ARROW
- END -> DOWN ARROW
- UP ARROW -> {
- DOWN ARROW -> }
- WIN KEY -> Delete
- CTRL leave as is
- ALT -> CTRL (on right cluster)

If using macOS then go ahead and configure the following changes IF YOU ARE NOT USING the advantage 360 keyboard as we have remappings for those.
